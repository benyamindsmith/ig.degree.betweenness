Description: Implements the degree-betweenness community detection algorithm 
    for network analysis using 'igraph' objects. This algorithm combines node 
    degree and betweenness centrality measures to identify communities within 
    networks. The package provides functions for community detection, 
    visualization, and analysis of the resulting community structure. Methods 
    are based on results from Smith, Pittman and Xu (2024) <doi>.
