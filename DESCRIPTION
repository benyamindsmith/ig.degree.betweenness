Description: Implements the "Smith-Pittman" community detection algorithm 
    for network analysis using 'igraph' objects. This algorithm combines node 
    degree and betweenness centrality measures to identify communities within 
    networks, with a gradient evident in social partitioning. The package 
    provides functions for community detection, visualization, and analysis of 
    the resulting community structure. Methods are based on results from Smith, 
    Pittman and Xu (2024) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2411.01394>.
